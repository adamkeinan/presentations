# Outline: Adventure as a career plan.

## What this talk _is_

-   Stories about unexpected connections that improved problem-solving ability
-   An attempt to debunk the myth that hobbies are ‚Äúa waste of time‚Äù
-   A love letter to curiosity

## What this talk _is not_

-   A roadmap encouraging people to follow in my footsteps
-   A guarantee of outcomes
-   A scientific breakdown of why certain strategies work

## Things to keep in mind:

-   The adjacent possible
-   Resiliency and follow-through
-   Lighting up the board to prove that anything is possible
-   Building confidence by lining up small successes
-   Reading fiction to become better at telling stories
-   Playing in a band to learn how to run a business
-   Working at a restaurant to learn organization, process, and consistency
-   Working as a night audit cleark to learn how to leverage my time
-   Marisa in HR; felt like it was a total waste of time
    -   Probably 70% of her skills overlap with her new role as an organizational architect
-   seeking vs. wandering
    -   Seeking is learning something: hobbies, training, new skills
        -   Known unknowns
    -   Wandering is disconnection and discovery: what else is out there? What don't I know?
        -   Unknown unknowns
    -   We should do both!

## Free writing to reason through an arc

In my life, I've held jobs ranging from a senior software architect at IBM to a Pizza Hut line cook; from a hotel night audit clerk to a door-to-door vacuum salesman; from a low-level supervisor at a Kinko‚Äôs to a grocery bagger at a supermarket.

I dropped out of college, slept on an air mattress for a year, lived in a van for two, and moved into an apartment with black mold for three. (I also had very supportive, if exasperated, parents, and a solid support structure in two very close childhood friends.)

My mom was convinced I was doomed. Once, after I'd given her another heaping helping of terrible news, she told me, "I really wish it was possible to return your first kid and get a do-over." (To be fair, I was being a giant asshole and deserved it.)

As far as the traditional "American Dream" career path goes, I did just about _everything_ wrong: I was mediocre in school, didn't get a degree, and in fact dropped out of college to pursue a "career" as a rockstar. From 18 until my early twenties, I wore eyeliner and tight pants and drove around the western United States playing "emo" music, which ‚Äî¬†for those who aren't familiar with it ‚Äî¬†is like melodramatic punk rock that takes itself _way_ too seriously as an artist.

When my dreams of becoming a rockstar evaporated, I should have been left at zero. I should have been out of options. I should have been _totally screwed_.

But I wasn't.

In fact, it was less than a year between hanging up my white belt and eyeliner and working full-time as a freelance web designer.

How is that possible, given that I wasted so much of my young life chasing this pipe dream of becoming a rock star?

It turns out, being a rockstar required me to learn more than just coming up with synonyms for "blood" and "heartbreak" and "sad". I had to learn how to network with venue owners, book shows, design merchandise, coordinate with vendors to print that merchandise, advertise, organize street teams, manage social media, negotiate with promoters to make sure we got paid ‚Äî I even had to build websites.

If you look at a Venn diagram of the skills I was learning and practicing in the band, and the skills I needed to run my agency, the overlap was intense. In fact, just about the only things that _didn't_ overlap were "sleeping in a van" and "playing music".

I didn't think much of this at the time. But looking back on it later, this struck me as a pretty incredible coincidence. How is it that I got _so lucky_ that I chose a foolish pursuit that just so happened to teach me a valuable skillset along the way?

Was it actually luck? Or was this something that gets left out of the usual "American Dream" story?

In retrospect, every job I ever held taught me something that has made me better in my career as a web developer:

-   washing dishes and cooking in restaurants taught me the importance of clear instructions, processes, consistency, and attention to detail
-   working as a hotel night audit clerk taught me how to leverage my time: I was able to use a huge portion of the night shift to learn more about web design (pro-tip for students: if you want to get paid for 6 hours a night of uninterrupted studying, work a night audit shift)
-   working in a call center helped me learn a little bit of empathy (I'm still not great at this) and to remain calm in the face of someone attacking the very core of your character because their cable went out
-   selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door taught me to overcome my fear of asking strangers for things, showed me how to frame a story to create outcomes, and helped me realize what predatory business models looked like so I could avoid them for the rest of my career

None of these jobs was something I considered a "career" ‚Äî and in fact, I took each of these jobs counting down the days until I could quit and do something I liked better. Yet each of them helped me learn and practice skills that I still use every single day, both in my work and in my life outside of it.

---

What does that mean? Did I just happen to stumble my way through a series of jobs that taught me skills that would eventually become useful in a career I didn't know I was working toward?

Or was this something else?

Let me start by saying this: I don't have any definitive answers. I also know that I was born lucky: I have mountains of privilege, from being born middle-class in the United States, to having a social support network, to being physically and mentally healthy (ish, at least).

So while I can only approach this from my own point of view, and I can't claim that any of this is science, I _can_ offer a few theories that ‚Äî anecdotally, at least ‚Äî seem to hold water.

[TKTK: Work in the concept of adventure; expand to make "adventure" a facet of curiosity. Set the stage for these theories to be relevant.]

### Theory 1: Adventurers trust themselves to be okay.

-   Curiosity relies on having the confidence to give something a shot

### Theory 2: We need to know the difference between "seeking" and "wandering" ‚Äî and embrace both.

-   Seeking: deliberate learning and practicing a skill (e.g. taking guitar lessons, going to college/conferences)
    -   This is deliberate practice done with a goal in mind
    -   Like a detective or a hunting dog: we have a goal and we hunt for clues and pathways that will get us there
-   Wandering: undirected experience of new things (e.g. tagging along with friends to an event you've never heard of, trying out something that sounds fun, intentionally interrupting patterns)
    -   This is often considered "play"
    -   Like an explorer: we have no destination; we just want to see what's out there
    -   Small Adventures

We tend to value "seeking": we set goals for ourselves and doggedly pursue them.

We tend to _devalue_ "wandering": we think it's a waste of time or a luxury to play.

Seeking is critically important. When I was learning web design, I spent months showing up at City Brew Coffee in Whitefish at 9am when they opened, and stayed there drinking coffee and learning web design and struggling through client projects until 6pm when they closed. And then I'd keep going when I went home.

Had I _not_ spent that time deliberately practicing design and code, I never would have developed the skills required to grow my agency or get to where I am today.

But consider this: _I only knew web design was a possibility for me because I played in a band._ Had I not been "wasting time" as a musician, I never would have needed to learn how to customize a MySpace page or build a website.

My wandering showed me a possible door; my seeking took me through it.

This symbiotic relationship between seeking and wandering creates potential for what Steven Johnson calls "The Adjacent Possible".

To understand the adjacent possible, imagine a room full of doors. We can open any of those doors that we choose, but we have no idea what's on the other side of them.

### Open the loop: how the hell did I get here?

-   My younger years from Mom‚Äôs perspective (10m)
    -   All bad decisions
    -   Today: I‚Äôm doing pretty well ‚Äî how?

### Core concept: seeking

-   Seeking is the deliberate pursuit of a defined goal
-   Our default is seeking:
    -   The American Dream is pretty much _all_ seeking
        -   Get a degree (we go to college _to become_ something, not to learn)
        -   Get a job
        -   Get a spouse
        -   Get a promotion
        -   Get a nest egg
        -   Get a house
        -   Get some kids
        -   Get a good retirement
-   Seeking is how we become great
    -   Deliberate practice (the ‚Äú10,000 Hours‚Äù theory)
    -   Chess sisters story
-   But _only_ seeking limits us
    -   Achievement-based thinking
    -   _Not_ achieving is seen as failure
    -   This can create a fear of failure
    -   Kids being told they‚Äôre smart decreases their effort (study)
-   Fear of failure can cause inertia
    -   ‚ÄúIf I might fail, it‚Äôs probably better not to try‚Äù
    -   High confidence in a narrow discipline
    -   Low confidence everywhere else
    -   It causes us to tell the wrong story to ourselves
        -   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the kind of person who can \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.‚Äù
-   ~~Failure~~ _Learning_
    -   Knowing what _doesn‚Äôt_ work can be just as helpful as knowing what does
    -   Copter Labs story
-   Failure teaches resilience
    -   Why is resilience important? (TKTK)
    -   Training for failure: Rejection Therapy (Jason Comely)
    -   Vacuum salesman story
-   Failure teaches self-reliance
    -   Rite of Passage
        -   E.g. ‚Äúspirit quest‚Äù, ‚Äúcoming of age‚Äù
    -   Self-sufficiency creates confidence
    -   ‚ÄúI can do this.‚Äù
    -   Examples of coming of age:
        -   Sending a kid to the woods: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come back for two weeks. Also don‚Äôt die.‚Äù
        -   Living alone for the first time
    -   Not all rites of passage happen when we‚Äôre kids
        -   Marisa‚Äôs divorce
        -   Alaska story
-   IMPORTANT: Seeking only works if we know what we‚Äôre trying to find

### Core concept: wandering

-   Wandering is undirected exploration
    -   Curiosity
    -   Continuing education
    -   Hobbies
    -   Play
-   Wandering is how we realize what the possibilities are
    -   Discover entirely new concepts and ideas
    -   Learn about new paths
-   We tend to see wandering as a leisure activity
    -   ‚ÄúKilling time‚Äù
    -   Not productive
    -   Distractions
    -   Procrastination
-   But wandering is a critical part of our development
    -   As kids, we play
    -   We follow our interests
    -   We learn about ‚Äúuseless‚Äù stuff
        -   My sister learned all the words to _Balto_
        -   Marisa learned every dog breed
    -   This shows us the doors we can walk through as adults
        -   We _need_ to wander to know what our options are
        -   Otherwise critical decisions about our life‚Äôs path will be made by default...
        -   ...or by other people
-   Wandering shows us possibilities
    -   Each possibility is a new area to explore
    -   If we keep exploring, we find _even more_ possibilities
    -   This is called ‚Äúthe adjacent possible‚Äù
-   The Adjacent Possible
    -   Steven Johnson
    -   Doors analogy
    -   But all doors come with you
        -   Not closing doors by learning
        -   Just finding more doors
-   Wandering helps build confidence
    -   Small successes in lots of different places add up
        -   Bad: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been able to figure this thing out; maybe I‚Äôm only good at this thing.‚Äù
        -   Good: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been able to figure out lots of stuff; I can probably figure this out, too.‚Äù
-   Wandering reduces risk
    -   Kinda
    -   Reduces _faux_-risk
    -
-   Wandering helps find connections
    -   Our subconscious is _really_ good at finding new connections between ideas
    -   But it only works if we shut off the conscious part of our brains
    -   This is why we often solve problems in the shower or in dreams
        -   TKTK find research
-   Wandering gives us different perspectives
    -   World travel story
        -   Exact same selfie joke
        -   Lots of wandering here: tax code, international visa law, travel hacks, language, food
    -   I am _so much more_ empathetic now

### Fears

-   ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that! It doesn‚Äôt help me reach my goals, so I‚Äôm wasting my time!‚Äù
    -   Show expected overlap (Venn diagram w/no overlap)
    -   There is _so much overlap_
        -   Venn diagram with quite a bit of overlap
        -   Most of every job is:
            -   Being able to function with other humans
            -   Managing your tasks and staying organized
            -   Managing your time
            -   Managing expectations
        -   The rest is pretty easy to learn in most cases
-   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like that; I don‚Äôt have natural talent.‚Äù
    -   Talent is a muscle
    -   _Bounce_ chess sisters story

### Close the loop: how my band days prepped me for a career in tech

-   I ~~failed~~ _learned_ often
    -   Bad shows
    -   Bad planning
    -   Bad merch that didn‚Äôt sell
-   I learned to depend on myself
    -   There was no one to design the merch, build the website, send the newsletter, book our tour, etc., etc., etc.
    -   I had no source of income, and my parents certainly weren‚Äôt going to support whatever the hell it was I was doing
-   I learned resilience
    -   We took video of every show and watched it afterward to find places to improve
    -   Cold calling venues to book shows, often turned down or ignored
    -   Asking strangers to buy merch and/or if we could sleep on their floor
-   I was curious
    -   I learned Photoshop and design
    -   I learned HTML, CSS, Flash, and some JavaScript
    -   I learned PHP
    -   I learned management: getting the band places on time, keeping track of our finances, ordering/selling merch, running social media campaigns, organizing street teams
-   I practiced
    -   The band played every day, either a live show or a band practice
    -   I worked on our designs constantly
    -   I rebuilt our web properties over and over again
-   I realized what was possible
-   I realized what I enjoyed ‚Äî and what I didn‚Äôt
-   When it all blew up, I already knew what I was interested in doing next
-   Many of the skills I had built for the band overlapped with freelance web design
    -   Venn diagram of band tasks vs. freelance tasks

### Action steps: how do I actually use this?

-   Seek intelligently
    -   If we seek too long, it feels hopeless
        -   No rewards; everything is ‚Äúin the future‚Äù
        -   Target feels impossible
    -   Set realistic goals, and break them up if necessary
    -   Use the ATOM Technique
        -   **Actionable** ‚Äî it can be worked on now
        -   **Time-Restricted** ‚Äî it has a short duration
        -   **Ownable** ‚Äî it has a single owner (you!)
        -   **Measurable** ‚Äî it has a clear definition of done
    -   Create small successes that build momentum
    -   Follow through and do the work
-   Wander often, but take action
    -   Set aside time to explore new ideas
    -   Have Small Adventures
        -   Low risk, low time commitment
        -   Something you don‚Äôt normally do
            -   Bake a cheesecake
            -   Go snorkeling
            -   Read about physics
            -   Take a dance class
    -   Let your subconscious work
        -   Be bored sometimes (e.g. no screens, no work)
        -   Take walks
        -   Spend time in nature
    -   Open doors just to see what‚Äôs there

### Summary

-   Seeking is executing a plan
-   Wandering is information gathering
-   Either approach alone won‚Äôt get you far
-   Together, they‚Äôll take you anywhere you want to go
