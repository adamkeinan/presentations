# Breaking Into Tech: How to Look Like Exactly Who Companies Want to Hire

Unfortunately, hiring in tech is broken. We use bad signals, silly interviewing techniques, gatekeeping, and a heaping helping of biases to choose who gets the job. This isn’t ideal, but if you’re clever about it, you can use this broken system to your advantage and land any tech job you want.

## What we _should_ be doing:

-   interviewing for character traits that are high-value to the company, for example:
    -   are you excited about learning?
    -   how quickly do you pick up new concepts? (e.g. have you learned how to learn?)
    -   are you an effective communicator and collaborator?
    -   can you lose an argument gracefully?
    -   do you have the grit to see through hard projects and problems?
-   getting a better understanding of your ability to do the actual work
    -   pair programming on an actual problem in the codebase
    -   small, paid, take-home projects that solve real problems
    -   review of real-world projects you’ve created

## What we are _actually_ doing:

-   asking trivia questions and brain teasers
-   asking candidates to solve academic problems that never come up in work
-   giving high value to public work and warm referrals

## How to use a broken system to land your dream job

1. Open source everything. Your personal site, hobby projects, school projects — everything. Work in public.
    - People are afraid to do this because they think they'll be judged by strangers.
    - The reality is that most public projects never get looked at unless you directly drive people to them.
    - When someone is reviewing your resume, they'll look at your GitHub profile. Having lots of repos creates the perception of experience.
    - Caveat: don't create repos and never contribute to them. A fork of a repo with zero changes doesn't improve your perceived value. It's better to have a few active repos vs. tons of inactive repos.
2. Contribute to open source projects. Edit the docs. Fix grammar and spelling mistakes. Add examples. If you're applying for a JS job and you can list "contributor to React" on your resume, people notice.
    - If you're worried about the friendliness of open source, come to Gatsby. We work really hard to keep the community open and welcoming to everyone.
3. Get involved in the community.
    - Follow popular people in your space on Twitter. They mostly talk about cutting edge stuff, but you'll pick up jargon and have a finger on the pulse of what's hot in development — this helps a lot in "sounding the part".
    - Go to local meetups. Ask questions. Go talk to the speakers.
    - Be helpful. As you learn, you'll be able to answer questions for people. Everyone has gaps in their knowledge, and sometimes you'll be able to fill those gaps. People remember helpful people, and they recommend them to their friends.
    - Tell people you're looking. You never know who's hiring, or who knows who. Warm referrals are _everything_, so being friendly and telling people you're looking is one of _the most_ critical parts of job hunting.
4. Share. Learn in public. Teach.
