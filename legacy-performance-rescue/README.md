# Rescuing a Legacy UI: 30x Faster with GraphQL, React, and Redis

Getting performance right is hard enough when we're starting a project from scratch — so is there any hope for old, slow UIs that were built years ago?

When they inherited a legacy app with certain views that took — *shudder* — 30 full seconds to load, Jason and his team needed to figure out how to integrate modern performance techniques into a monolithic, sluggish codebase. Is it even possible?

In this talk, Jason will walk through the process his team used to improve page loads by 250% — and perceived load times by over 3100% — using only front-end techniques. With a combination of GraphQL and React, what was previously the slowest (by far!) section of our product became one of the fastest. And with the addition of Redis for caching, people now have a near-instant experience.

By the end of this talk, you'll have a new set of enterprise-tested techniques that are usable today, powered by open source technology, and don't require much time to put in place.
