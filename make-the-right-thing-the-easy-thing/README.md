# Make the Right Thing the Easy Thing: How to Design Systems and Processes Teams Actually Follow

## tl;dr for the tl;dr

How can we convince an entire team to follow best practices and keep our codebase healthy? In this talk, learn how Jason and his team are creating and scaling processes to improve code quality while reducing technical debt, knowledge silos, and maintenance costs — and how to use them on your team.

## tl;dr

When we work alone, it’s easy to make sure things come out the way we think is best. But what happens when we need to get an entire team to agree on — and actually _use_ — best practices? What if we have to convince an entire _company_? In this talk, see how Jason Lengstorf and his team are working to create best practices that IBM teams around the world will actually follow, and how this has led to better developer experience, increased velocity, decreased technical debt, higher reliability, and many more improvements. Learn battle-tested strategies and techniques that will benefit companies of any size, helping create teams that are more engaged, more effective, and more cohesive.

## Full Description

When we work alone, it’s easy to make sure things come out the way we think is best. But what happens when we need to get an entire team to agree on — and actually _use_ — best practices? What if we have to convince an entire _company_?

In this talk, we’ll learn how IBM is working to get huge, distributed teams to not only agree on a set of best practices but to actually follow them, leading to:

* Improved developer experience and engagement
* Increased velocity
* Decreased technical debt
* Fewer knowledge silos
* Lower maintenance overhead
* Higher reliability
* Broad adoption of best practices
* and many more improvements in team cohesion and quality

Learn battle-tested strategies and techniques that will benefit companies of any size, helping create teams that are more engaged, more effective, and more cohesive.

## Notes

This is a talk about creating solid communication between teams, fostering healthy discussions, and landing on a set of community guidelines that will help developers in all levels of the organization confidently contribute high-quality code that improves the product. This includes techniques like introducing peer reviews, training senior developers to build their team (and not try to heroically build the whole product themselves), introducing automated checks for quality (e.g. static analysis, linting) that make compliance checks impersonal and non-subjective, and learning to communicate the importance of these practices to _everyone_ — especially the executive and managerial stakeholders who can introduce deadline pressure that inadvertently blows up the best laid plans.

## Outline

* My first day at IBM: no docs, no onboarding — just a Slack channel and "ask \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, he knows everything"
* Finding the knowledge silos
* Unraveling years of spaghetti code
* Realizing that there were almost no tests, no code analysis, and very little code review happening
* Weeping
* Deciding to do something about it
* Choosing the main areas to focus on:
  * Static code analysis (create a dashboard to show technical debt and common code issues)
  * Automated style adherence with Prettier to sidestep debates
  * Linting rules for common problems (e.g. complexity, common antipatterns)
  * Testing requirements (e.g. coverage requirements for new code, including testing in scope estimation)
  * Continuous integration tools, automated releases, and other automations to improve consistency
  * Designing onboarding and team-building efforts to create a culture defined by quality software
  * Internal education and documentation to make all of the above easier
* How we created the plan to roll all of this out
* The roadblocks we hit, and how we overcame (most of) them
* How we’re working to ensure the culture doesn't backslide
* How we're communicating the importance of quality-driven software to upper management
* What's left on our roadmap
* Resources
