# Who Gives a Fuck About a Monad?
### Functional Programming for People Who Hate Math

— or —

# No Math Required
### Functional Programming for the Rest of Us

Functional programming is a game-changer. Used properly, it means:

- Cleaner code
- Simpler to maintain
- Easier to test
- 100% predictable, every time

Despite that, most of us never get started with functional programming. But why?

The discussion about functional programming tends to immediately spiral off into the mathematical stratosphere: any benefits of functional programming are buried under thick layers of unfamiliar jargon about lambda calculus and monads and unary functions and composition and purity.

That's a lot of words. Math-sounding words. And math sucks, right?

As a result, most of us never learn how useful the concepts of functional programming can be — we're asleep long before the conversation reaches that point.

But here's the thing: functional programming does not require a post-graduate degree in category theory. There's _no math required_ to learn functional programming.

In this talk, we'll take a jargon-free look at functional programming concepts, and how we can apply them _today_ — no hardcore math required — to make our code more reliable, predictable, and maintainable.
