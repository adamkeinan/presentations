          <aside class="notes">
            When we were kids, my mom would start a story timer and say, "Okay. You’ve
            got five minutes to wrap this up." Every story was a maze of tangents,
            useless details, and rambling nonsense. There may have been a point in 
            there, but none of us were ever able to tease it out.

          <aside class="notes">
            Choose only the right details, and the story becomes more powerful.
            Include too many and it becomes hard-to-follow and boring.

          <h3>“But all of these details are <strong>absolutely essential</strong> to my presentation!”</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            You may feel like leaving out details will rob your audience of the impact,
            but you'd be sorely mistaken. Don't believe me? Allow me to present one of
            the most impactful (and complete) stories I've ever seen:

        <section>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“For sale: baby shoes, never worn.”<br><small><strong>– Ernest Hemingway (probably apocryphal)</strong></small></p>
          </blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            This is a single detail, but we easily understand the entire tragic story.
            The origin of this story is unclear, but it's apocryphally attributed to
            Hemingway, who used it to win a bet that he couldn't write a full story in
            six words. If Hemingway can write a tragedy in six words, we can write a
            fucking PowerPoint slide in a sentence or two.

            Try to frame everything from the perspective of the person listening. How

          <h4>Step 1:</h4>
          <h1>Find the Thing That <strong class="hugify">Hurts</strong></h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            This could be something obvious that everyone complains about all the time
            already; or it could be something subtle that no one has thought of yet
            but can’t live without once they know it exists, like wheels on suitcases.

          <h4>Step 2:</h4>
          <h1><strong class="hugify">Poke It</strong></h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            Remind them how painful it is. Try to paint a mental picture of how 
            frustrating this problem can be, or ask them to reflect on the last time
            they had to use the problematic thing. If you’re doing this right, someone
            in the audience will groan audibly.

          <aside class="notes">
            With the pain fresh in the audience’s mind, the power of the solution is
            much more apparent. If I show you a blanket with sleeves, you might laugh

          <h2>Tip #3</h2>
          <h1>Don’t Rely <strong>Too Much</strong> on Your Slides</h1>
          <aside class="notes">A good slide deck is a <em>visual aid</em>. Your presentation should still be
            engaging, even if the projector or screenshare gives out.

          <aside class="notes">
            Don’t try to fit everything you want to say on a slide. You’re 
            <em>speaking</em> to the audience; not standing there while they read.

        <section>
          <h2>Slides are <strong>not</strong> a script.</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Reading slides verbatim is distracting, boring, and a waste of time. If
            the audience can get the same experience simply by reading the slides, you
            may as well skip the talk altogether and send them a PDF instead.

          <h2>Slides are <strong>not</strong> a collection of your favorite GIFs.</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            I love GIFs, and I use a lot of them. But if your whole deck is funny GIFs
            — unless that’s the schtick — you’re more likely to distract from your
            talk than add to it.

            Actors get paid to recite memorized lines because it’s hard not to sound
            like a cardboard cutout when you’re reciting something from memory. So

            The hero gives us someone to pull for, and allows us to tie emotions to
            the events taking place. Without heroes, most stories start to sound like

            Without following the hero’s preparation, the ending feels pretty
            anticlimactic: “Harry Potter found himself targeted by an evil wizard, but
            then he won the big wizard battle.” The middle part of the story helps us
            identify with the hero and builds suspense. For business, this could be a
            high-level overview of various challenges, partners, and strategies. It
            can also include any failed attempts along the way — this also helps build
            suspense.

          <aside class="notes">
            This is the climax of the story. After all the preparation, the hero is
            ready to take on the challenge. This is the moment of truth, where we find
            out if the preparation paid off. In business, this might be where the
            customer puts our product to the test during a holiday promotion — and it
            pulls through for her. She has her best month ever and she’s able to buy
            gifts for her family.

            After the conflict, we need to see how things shake out in the end. What
            does normal life look like now? This is a good place to reflect on what
            was learned during the project, or how we plan to provide the same results
            to <em>all</em> of our customers.

            The idea of sharing failures and shortcomings with total strangers is
            <em>fucking terrifying</em>, but try not to only put your best foot forward.
            Without flaws, we find it hard to relate to each other. This is why
            Superman is such a tough character: he doesn’t have any flaws, and that
            makes him seem stiff and two-dimensional. Be willing to put the bad out
            with the good, and people will relate to your stories far better.
