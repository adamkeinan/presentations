# Content Outline

- Let's Pretend:
    - You've built something cool
    - People should know about this
    - You mention it to a client/coworker/conference
    - They ask you to give a presentation about it
    - ...now what?
- Presentations suck
    - 
- But they don't have to
    - TED
- So what's the difference?
    - Is it better design?
    - Professional speakers?
- Nope.
- The actual difference:
    - Don't bury your audience in details
    - Focus on the big ideas and benefits
    - Minimal slides
    - Practice
    - The Ultimate Presenter's Tool (stay tuned to find out what it is!)
- Good Presentations Focus on Concepts and Outcomes
    - Carly story (story timer, dozens of irrelevant details, lost plot)
    - The power of a concise story:
        - "For sale: baby shoes, never worn." – Hemingway (apocryphal, but still fucking awesome)
    - Questions to ask:
        - What was the problem?
        - Why was it a problem?
        - How did solving it benefit people?
        - What unexpected challenges came up while solving the problem?
    - The details largely don't matter, and will (almost definitely) bore the audience to tears.
- Good Presentations Don't Rely Too Much on Slides
    - Data-heavy slides are distracting and boring (show example)
    - Simple slides are intriguing and seamlessly fade behind your words (show example)
    - No one wants to watch someone read slides for 45 minutes
    - A good slide is a launchpad for a thought, not notes on what you want to say
        - That's what speaker notes are for!
- Good Presentations Are Practiced
    - This _does not_ mean writing a script and memorizing it
    - It _does_ mean running through the talk — out loud — beforehand to spot awkward transitions, useless slides, tangents, and areas where more info is needed
    - Make sure to review the content and slides thoroughly within 12 hours of the presentation
        - "'Defrosting' a talk can be harder than writing the thing in the first place." – Lorna Mitchell
- The Ultimate Presenter's Tool: Stories
    - A good story evokes an emotion
    - "But what if my project is boring?"
        - Does this sound interesting?
            - A report on nominative determinism and its potential impact on socioeconomic status and mobility. (_Freakonomics_ — names and the potential impact on job prospects)
            - The story of four strangers who take a road trip to ask a politician for things they already have. (_The Wizard of Oz_)
            - A detailed account of a grumpy alcoholic's poor life choices. (everything by Bukowski)
    - A good story follows an arc:
        - Introduce someone relatable (the hero)
        - Introduce a challenge (writing a presentation?)
        - Follow along with preparation to create suspense (collecting tools)
        - Build up to the moment of truth (giving the presentation)
        - Share lessons learned and wrap it up (the moral of the story)
    - Don't shy away from getting personal
        - Vulnerability is an extremely powerful tool — don't by shy about adding your struggles, shortcomings, and embarrassing moments to the story
            - This makes the story feel realistic and human
            - This makes you relatable
- Putting It Into Practice: Let's Get Meta
    - What did we do in this presentation?
        - Introduced a hero: me!
        - Framed a challenge: present on boring content
        - Gathered tools: outcomes-focused content, minimal slides, practice, and stories
        - Faced the moment of truth: err, technically I'm still doing that part
        - Shared lessons learned: see slide 1
    - This was not an exciting topic
    - But I _made_ it exciting.
        - You laughed
        - You cried
        - You gasped
        - You learned
        - You grew as human beings
        - And when it was all over, you showered me with roses and applause
- [cue roses and applause]
- Questions?
