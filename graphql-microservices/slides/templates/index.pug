    ul(style="width: 75%")
      li.fragment Building web things since 2003
      li.fragment Senior developer / front-end architect for IBM Cloud
      li.fragment Former workaholic / current work-life balance advocate
      li.fragment #[em Obsessed] with processes &amp; efficiency
      li.fragment Old man at heart

  +slide
    h3 GraphQL is one of the most exciting things I’ve worked on in a long time
    
    aside.notes.
      I’m not going to go deep into the benefits of GraphQL. Other people have
      written great introductions to GraphQL and what it can do — and each
      speaker at this event will highlight different benefits of GraphQL, but 
      in particular, I was really interested in the ways GraphQL would let us
      improve our front-end developer experience and even out an uneven API
      surface. (Also, the auto-documentation benefits were pretty appealing.)

  +slide
    h3 I wanted to start using it in production immediately

  +slide
    h3 Not everyone was on board

    aside.notes.
      When I initially started playing with this concept, I was ready to go
      all-in on GraphQL. But other teams immediately started voicing concerns,
      and a number of really good questions were raised.

  +slide
    h4 Before we get into the details,#[br]let me set the scene&hellip;

    aside.notes.
      Before I bring up the questions that were asked, let me give you some
      insight into the way things are structured on our product.

  +slide
    h3 How IBM Cloud is built:
    ul
      li.fragment Node µ-service architecture
      li.fragment 30+ teams contribute code to the console
      li.fragment Each team owns a “plugin” (µ-service)
      li.fragment Each plugin is a separate Git repo
      li.fragment Teams control their commit and deploy workflow
    
    aside.notes.
      Teams basically have full autonomy to build however they want. This is
      great for empowering our teams, but it’s led to consistency problems.
      Documentation is spotty, hidden in wikis, and usually incomplete and/or
      out of date. You have to know someone who knows someone to get help
      fetching data from a new back-end service. Developers can’t help out
      other teams because the codebases are so different that it takes too long
      to get familiar with a new plugin.

  +slide
    h3 This has its downsides:
    ul
      li.fragment Code can be wildly inconsistent between µ-services
      li.fragment It’s almost impossible to know everything that’s happening on the console
      li.fragment Front-ends need to hit multiple back-end services for the data they need
      li.fragment Back-end APIs lack consistent documentation and data organization
      li.fragment Teams rarely control the data they rely on

  +slide
    h3(style="width: 110%; margin-left: -5%;") GraphQL has solutions:
    ul
      li.fragment Front-ends only need to hit one endpoint for all data
      li.fragment Documentation is centralized and predictable
      li.fragment Tools like GraphiQL simplify development
      li.fragment It creates a cleaner, more enforceable separation between the data layer and the presentation layer

  +slide
    h3(style="width: 110%; margin-left: -5%;") But there are complications:
    ul
      li.fragment Who “owns” the GraphQL µ-service?
      li.fragment How can teams own the schema for their µ-services?
      li.fragment How do we give teams control over the deployment process for individual data sources?
      li.fragment How can we prevent one team from breaking another team’s code?
      li.fragment Doesn’t an extra layer make it harder to trace errors?
      li.fragment Can GraphQL handle IBM’s enormous scale?
  
  +slide
    h3 We wanted the #[em benefits] of GraphQL&hellip;
      span.fragment  but could we afford the trade-offs?
  
  +slide
    h2 We needed #[em answers]

  +slide.u--align-left
    h3 How can we...
    ul
      li.fragment prevent GraphQL from becoming a development bottleneck?
      li.fragment make sure teams keep control of their own data?
      li.fragment protect teams from outside code introducing bugs?
      li.fragment improve the error handling experience?
      li.fragment be 100% sure the GraphQL µ-service will scale?

  +slide.u--align-left
    h3 And furthermore...
    ul
      li.fragment How do we drive adoption to make sure teams #[strong actually use GraphQL]?
      li.fragment How can we avoid the quality and documentation problems we had with REST?

  +slide
    h3 We had problems to solve:
    ol
      li.fragment Can we give teams control without losing the benefits of GraphQL?
      li.fragment Can we design an approach that #[em improves] error handling?
      li.fragment Can we make the adoption process so pleasant that teams #[em want] to adopt?
      li.fragment Can we build a service that can handle IBM’s scale?

  //- STANDARDIZE WHAT A DATA SOURCE IS
  +slide
    h4.no-margin Problem 1:
    h2.no-margin #[em Decentralize] Control, but Centralize Data

  +slide
    h3 Solution:
    p
      span Each team maintains their own GraphQL schema...
      br
      span.fragment  but that schema is aggregated by a central µ-service.

  +slide
    h2 We call these#[br]“Data Sources”

  +slide
    h3 If this was going to work, we needed a #[em standardized format] for data sources.

  +slide
    h3 A Data Source consists of:
    ul
      li 
        strong GraphQL schema
        span.fragment : describes the data
      li 
        strong Resolver functions
        span.fragment : maps data to the schema
      li.fragment
        strong Connector
        span.fragment : determines where to load data from
      li.fragment
        strong Model
        span.fragment : defines methods for getting specific data
      li.fragment
        strong Main export
        span.fragment : makes it possible to combine data sources
    p.fragment
      small Hat tip to Jonas Helfer for the initial concept.

  +slide
    h3 Each data source is an #[em independent] GitHub repo, which means:
    ul.align-center
      li.fragment ✅ No bottlenecks
        br
        small Each team commits and deploys code independently.
      li.fragment ✅ No loss of control
        br
        small Each team owns their data source.
      li.fragment ✅ No accidental borking
        br
        small Each team’s code has individual test suites.

  +slide
    h3 Stitching it together:
    ul
      li.fragment The GraphQL µ-service core is an empty schema
      li.fragment Each data source is an npm package, which is added as a dependency
      li.fragment.
        Express middleware composes the data sources into a single set of 
        arguments for use with the Apollo Express server

  +slide
    h4 This Is a Simple Apollo GraphQL Server
    pre
      code.js.
        import Express from 'express';
        import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
        import { graphqlExpress } from 'apollo-server-express';

        import mySchema from './schema';

        const app = new Express();
        app.use(bodyParser.json());
        app.use('/graphql',
          graphqlExpress({ schema: mySchema }),
        );

  +slide
    h4 Our new pattern doesn’t change much
    ol
      li.fragment Swaps the single, local schema for a variable number of data source packages
      li.fragment Adds a piece of middleware
      li.fragment Updates the Apollo GraphQL server to use the combined schema

  +slide
    h4 1. Use external packages vs. a single schema
    pre
      code.diff.
        - import mySchema from './schema';
        + import schemaOne from '@gramps/data-source-one';
        + import schemaTwo from '@gramps/data-source-two';

  +slide
    h4 2. Add the schema-combining middleware
    pre
      code.diff.
        + import { grampsExpress } from '@gramps/gramps-express';

          const app = new Express();
          app.use(bodyParser.json());

        + app.use(
        +   grampsExpress({
        +     dataSources: [
        +       schemaOne,
        +       schemaTwo,
        +     ],
        +   }),
        + );

  +slide
    h4 3. Update to use the combined schema
    pre
      code.diff.
          app.use('/graphql',
        -   graphqlExpress({ schema: mySchema }),
        +   graphqlExpress(req => ({ schema: req.combinedSchema })),
          );
    aside.notes.
      The goal of the project was to make it as simple as possible to add new 
      data sources, so we didn’t want to make people mess with configuration or

    h3 This Means:
    ul
      li.fragment Support tickets can reference errors and developers can find additional details in the logs easily
      li.fragment Development is faster because errors are clear and come with links to docs for solving them
      li.fragment We avoid confusion about which µ-service is the source of a given error

  +slide
    h3 Step 1: Create a #[em CLI]

        ============================================================
  
  +slide
    h3 But there was a #[strong snag]:
    p.fragment.
      “How do we run a local instance of the GraphQL#[br]µ-service if the data source
      we’re developing is already installed? Won’t they collide?”

  +slide
    h3 The solution?
    h2 Allow local#[br]data sources#[br]to #[em override]
    p
      code.sh gramps --data-source-dir ./

    aside.notes.
      We built a CLI to make development easier, then added checks for
      data source name collisions, giving local data sources precedence.

  +slide
    h4 But add a #[em warning]
