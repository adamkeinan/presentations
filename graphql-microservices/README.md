# Bringing GraphQL to the Enterprise: When IBM Met Apollo

In a micro-service architecture, managing API surfaces can get out of control in a hurry. On bigger teams, utter chaos is just one breaking change away. In this talk, we'll take a look at how IBM's Bluemix is leveraging GraphQL to unify dozens of independent REST APIs into a single, explorable data layer â€” all while seeing _huge_ (~2.5x) performance gains. Take a peek under the hood of our codebase and learn how GraphQL can help you create a better, more reliable platform, which will improve the experience for both the people using the platform AND the people building it.

## Objectives

Introduce the benefits of GraphQL, dig into Apollo's open source tools for GraphQL, explore the micro-service architecture IBM is using, and touch on testing, mocking data, and the vastly improved developer experience.

## Target Audience

Developers who work with large teams that need to expose and consume data from multiple sources.
