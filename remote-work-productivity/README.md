# What World Travel Taught Us About Work
### How working on a beach in Thailand made us more productive.

## tl;dr

In late 2014, Marisa Morby and Jason Lengstorf boarded a flight to Europe with no return ticket. They spent two years traveling full-time, living in over a dozen countries on three continents, all while trying to keep their freelance businesses afloat. Two years later, here's what they've learned — and how you can apply their strategies to skyrocket your productivity (and free time).

## Longer Description

The worst feeling we can have at work is futility. Did another day just fly by where nothing of consequence got done? Did we just spend a whole week having meetings and trading emails without getting any closer to a deliverable?

*For people who work online, the danger of wasting entire days — or even _weeks_ — is very real, and without the right tools and mindset, we can burn hundreds of hours in unproductive meetings or on work-like tasks that aren't actually moving us toward our goals.*

When Jason and Marisa started traveling full-time in 2014, they expected the hardest part of working remotely to be _working_ — but it turns out the hard part is getting the right information to get work done: *when you're halfway around the world and you realize that you're missing something critical, that means you lose a whole day while you wait for someone else to wake up and answer your questions.*

Once they got the hang of it, Marisa and Jason realized they were hitting levels of productivity they'd never dreamed of before. In this talk, they'll share the strategies and reusable frameworks that allowed them to grow and improve their careers _and_ their personal lives — all while traveling through a dozen countries.

In this talk, you'll learn:

* How Marisa was able to _completely shift careers_ from half a world away.
* How Jason *increased his annual earnings by 20% — while working 40% fewer hours.*
* How Marisa went from *zero to a full client load* — with glowing referrals — all from the other side of the planet.
* How Jason stayed *on budget and ahead of schedule with _at most_ one meeting per day* — even while collaborating with teams spread across multiple continents.

Attendees will receive reusable frameworks for:

* planning projects
* choosing which project to prioritize
* holding more productive (and shorter! and fewer!) meetings
* improving email effectiveness, clarity, and quality

Attendees will also be introduced to tools for:

- Passive time tracking — and why it's so important
- Project management — and ways to make it collaborative instead of prescriptive
- Improved Communication — so things don't get lost in translation, misunderstood, or buried in our inboxes or chat histories

The best part? These tips aren't just applicable to remote work. *You can implement Marisa and Jason's strategies and frameworks into your workflow _today_ to turboboost your productivity, maximize your efficiency, and become one of the top contributors on your team.* Want to work remotely? Make a killing as a freelancer? Get a promotion? Maximize your bonuses and pay raises? _These strategies_ are how you make that happen.

And whether you're brand new to your career like Marisa was, or someone with years of experience like Jason, these tips will leave you wishing you'd known this stuff earlier. (At least, Jason and Marisa certainly wish they had.)

And as an extra-special bonus, you'll get to see _so many selfies_ of Jason and Marisa in front of famous landmarks.
