# What Remote Work Taught Us About Getting Things Done

## tl;dr

In late 2014, Marisa Morby and Jason Lengstorf boarded a flight to Europe with no return ticket. They spent two years traveling full-time, living in over a dozen countries on three continents, all while trying to keep their freelance businesses afloat. Two years later, here's what they've learned — and how you can apply their strategies to skyrocket your productivity (and free time).

## Longer Description

Why is it that some days fly by, and — even though we were _present_ at work — it feels like very little actually got _done_?

Maybe we spent the whole day in meetings. Maybe we didn't have all the materials to get started. Maybe we were waiting on someone else to finish so we could start.

Whatever it was, it certainly doesn't feel good to waste a day.

So how can we improve our day-to-day approach to work and maximize our effectiveness and productivity?

For the last two years, Jason Lengstorf and Marisa Morby have been anywhere from 5 to 15 hours ahead of their clients and coworkers. Jason has coordinated product launches with a Canadian team from a coffee shop in Thailand. Marisa has built marketing campaigns for an Italian software company from her apartment in Tokyo.
