# Killer Speed, Quality Code, Better UX, and Simpler Development Workflow ðŸ”¥

## How modern front-end workflows are changing everything

Is your stack so intuitive junior devs can pick it up in a day? Does it allow you to keep working even if the staging server is down? Is it crazy fast? Can you work 2â€“3x faster than before? In this talk, weâ€™ll see how modern workflows provide all these benefits and more â€” all with minimal rewrites.

## Full Abstract

Modern front-end development is hard: more and more of the app logic is moving into the browser, putting more demands on front-end developers than ever before. This added complexity has led to a huge boom in tools and frameworks â€” and the results are incredible. In this talk, weâ€™ll take a look at how the combination of modern JS frameworks and a modern data layer creates a better development experience than weâ€™ve ever had before.

Learn how these practices are being applied at some of the largest tech companies in the world to get incredible results, including:

- Intuitive data access that developers of all skill levels can understand
- Built-in patterns for boosting perceived performance
- Increased autonomy for teams
- Huge improvements in turnaround time and code quality

Modern tools give us these improvements (almost) free, and the improvements can be dramatic: one of our pages saw a 245% improvement in loading time.

The future of front-end is awesome. See how you can start living in the future today.
