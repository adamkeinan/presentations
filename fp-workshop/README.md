# Workshop: Functional Programming Without the Math

Used properly, functional programming means cleaner code, easier maintenance, and simpler testing. But most of us will never use it. Why? Because **functional programming is usually explained with jargon**, complex math, and some nonsense about monads or whatever. And math is hard, so most of us run away screaming. **But here's the thing: functional programming doesn't actually require math.** This talk explains how we can get the benefits of functional programming today — with _no math required_.

## Workshop Description
In this workshop, you’ll get practice writing code using functional techniques,
including array methods, combining lots of small functions into more complex functions, and writing general purpose functions that we’ll turn into specialized functions with almost zero additional code.

All of this leads to better code that’s typically shrouded under a few layers of jargon such as _composability_, _referential transparency_, _variadic functions_, and _partial application_.

By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a new set of development tools and techniques borrowed from functional programming, and you won’t have to learn any complicated math along the way.
