# Modern Front-End Performance Strategies and Techniques

How can we make our websites faster if we have no control over the server? Is that even possible?

In this workshop, we’ll learn strategies and techniques for improving _perceived_ load times — how long it _feels_ like it takes to load a page — as well as _actual_ load times, using only front-end techniques including:

*   The skeleton loading pattern
*   Better loading for static assets
*   Lazy loading
*   Service Workers
*   Better build processes
*   and more

We’ll use these techniques to refactor a web app, giving you hands-on experience with your new performance toolkit.
