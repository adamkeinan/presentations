# The JS Dogma and Pony Show

When we arbitrarily separate the world into concepts, they become ideas that can divide people.

For example: if I look at a plant and decide that I'm looking at a banana, and you decide you're looking at a tree, and someone else decides they're looking at a bunch of bananas, we're all right. But if we choose to be dogmatic, we could argue about it anyways.
