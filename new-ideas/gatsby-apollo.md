# Beyond Static With Gatsby & Apollo

## Elevator Pitch

For most of us, “static sites” only work for simple sites, like personal blogs. But static sites can do so much more! In this talk, learn how Gatsby & Apollo help you build apps that combine the performance and workflow benefits of static sites with the flexibility and power of server-driven sites.

## Full Abstract

For most of us, the phrase “static site” makes us think of blogs and sales pages. Most of us might say, “It’s fine for small sites to be static, but they can’t handle ‘serious’ applications.”

Most of us, it turns out, are mistaken.

In this talk, learn how combining Gatsby with Apollo allows you to build apps that are:

-   Screaming fast because performance is baked in
-   Cheap to host because no servers are required
-   Built on a modern stack with React and GraphQL
-   Capable of pulling in data from your CMS, API, flat files, and beyond
-   Fully capable web apps with support for auth, ecommerce, and more

By the end of this talk, you’ll see multiple real-world examples of how Gatsby & Apollo give you the speed and workflow benefits of static sites with all the flexibility of dynamic apps. You’ll have a clear picture of the incredible potential of this hybrid app stack to go far beyond the limits of traditional static sites.
