## Build Blazing Fast Dynamic Apps With Gatsby

TKTK

## Full Abstract

Over 50% of people will abandon a mobile site if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. Unless you’re willing to give up half of your potential customers, performance is no longer optional on the modern web.

Fortunately, there are a lot of tools available to help you build screaming fast websites. Unfortunately, there’s a frighteningly large number of performance considerations, and many of them are really easy to get wrong.

In this workshop, you’ll use React and GraphQL to build a blazing-fast web app from scratch using Gatsby, a performance-centered app framework.

*   Create dynamic apps — even when using a static site generator!
*   Load data and content from any back-end
*   Automatically optimize images for fast load times
*   Improve critical performance measures like time-to-first-byte and time-to-interactive
*   Decrease the amount of work the browser needs to do to render your site
*   Implement the PRPL pattern for screaming fast load times
*   Further improve the experience for returning visitors with Progressive Web App techniques
*   And much more

By the end of this workshop, you’ll have built a screaming fast, flexible, modern website from scratch using the most advanced performance tuning techniques available — without needing to become a performance expert yourself.
