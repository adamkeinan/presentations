# Content management for large teams: adopting a modern dev stack without migrating everything

On large teams or legacy apps, we often get stuck using tech stacks we're not particularly excited about because the content is already set up somewhere and migration is too big a task to take on right now. But what if it was possible to use your existing content

Working on teams, we often get stuck using tech stacks we don't love because it's where the content lives — and migrating a ton of content is a long, painful, usually disastrous process.

Wouldn't it be great to develop your product on a modern tech stack without having to migrate all of that content and train your marketing team on a new CMS?

In this talk, learn how you can have your cake and eat it, too:

*   Build blazing fast apps using a modern stack: React, GraphQL
*   Let the content team use the CMS they already know and prefer
*

At larger companies, we often face a paradox: we want all the benefits of our preferred CMS, but the development experience is... rough. Or, we want all the power of a modern development stack, but that would require the content team to learn Markdown. As more SaaS services come into play, developers find themselves trying to pull third-party data into their CMS.

In this talk, we’ll explore a better way that gives us the best of both worlds, including:

*   Keeping the content in your preferred CMS
*   Working with a modern dev stack (e.g. React, GraphQL)
*   Loading data from third-party services without hacky workarounds
*   Lowering development overhead through better tooling

Come see how we can solve the CMS paradox by keeping the WYSIWYG for content management and the best dev tools for actually building things.

## What are the benefits the listener leaves with?

*   The content team can use their preferred CMS
*   The dev team can develop with a modern tech stack, e.g. React + GraphQL
*   Data can be stored in and loaded from multiple places without tons of development overhead
*   The back-end gets all the benefits of established CMS tooling
*   The front-end gets all the performance benefits of modern front-end tooling
