# Presentations by Jason Lengstorf

I have too many repos that aren't actually useful on their own because they're disjointed presentations, demos, and other nonsense.

The goal of this repo is to create a single location where presentations live, including relevant demos, slide decks, and other resources.

> Jason Lengstorf is a developer, designer, author, and friendly bear. He's worked in nearly every role in an agency — and when he first started his company, he _was_ every role in the agency — and uses his 10+ years of experience to approach problems from a truly full-stack perspective, from marketing and sales all the way through architecture and DevOps.
> 
> In the course of his career, Jason **has written several books and dozens of tutorials about development, built and sold a successful web agency, and built award-winning projects for companies like PlayStation, Intel, and Precision Nutrition.**
> 
> After selling his agency, Jason **spent two years [traveling the world and working remotely](https://lengstorf.com/remote-work-travel/)** as a contractor.
> 
> Jason **recently joined [IBM Design](http://www.ibm.com/design/) as a senior front-end developer** to help redefine how IBM approaches front-end development, contribute to better development processes, improve tooling, and mentor IBM’s new hires.
> 
> He lives in Austin, TX, spends most of his disposable income on food and travel, and can often be spotted foraging for berries in the forest.
